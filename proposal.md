Checkers
This project is to make a digital version of the checkers game using Python. Two players will be able to play against each other, moving pieces on a virtual board and following the usual checkers rules. The main goals are to make the game easy to play, ensure all moves are valid.

1- An interactive 8x8 board where players can click to select and move pieces.

2- Game rules that include capturing opponents' pieces and "kinging" pieces that reach the other side.

3- The game ends when one player has no pieces left or can't make a valid move.



Technologies: pycharm, python, html files, css, flask, loops, dictionarries
